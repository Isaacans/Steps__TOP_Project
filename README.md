# Steps: A Project From, TOP
Accomplish anything with Steps, a to-do list and tracker app.

Link to deployment: http://isaacans.github.io/steps__top_project



Break down goals, tasks or projects into smaller steps that once completed will mean that your goal/task/project has been achieved. 
Break those steps down further, with each having another optional list of mini-steps to complete each step.

Tracker helps keep track of your consistency and how much time you spend making progress.
